# [Project 1: Movie Recommendation System Model](https://github.com/RonitMalik/Movie-Recommendation-System-)

This is a project I did for my masters research paper, where I built a recommendation system for a movies dataset.

* Data was taken from the movielens dataset  
* The model uses both: content-based filtering techniques and collaborative filtering techniques.  
* Algorithms Used: K-Nearest Neighbours, TF-IDFS, Singular Value Decomposition Model (SVD), Alternating Least Square (ALS)  
* Optimised the SVD & ALS model.  
* The Project Write-up is published on [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3791837)

# [Project 2: Amazon Price Scrapper](https://github.com/RonitMalik/BlackFriday_pythonScrapper)

This was part of a personal project where a python price scraper was built in order to track prices for specific items on amazon.  
The way the model works is you add a link to the amazon product and the price you’re willing to buy the product at (Target Price)  
and it will refresh the script every 24 hours and check the price for the product, as soon as the price of the product reaches your target price it will send you an email alert.

I have also done an entire walkthrough video on youtube for the amazon price scraper and how you can build one too. [Click Here]
